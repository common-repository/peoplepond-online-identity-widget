Extends the reach of your PeoplePond profile & verified identity. Displays a badge detailing who you are & where you can be found.

== Description ==

Extend the reach and usability of your [PeoplePond](http://www.peoplepond.com) profile, including your verified identity, with the PeoplePond Identity Widget in the sidebar of your WordPress blog. It will display a badge to your blog readers detailing who you are and what other services they can follow you on.

A PeoplePond profile is the hub of your online identity. It serves to train the search engines about you and where to find all your best online assets. It also provides a single location for your followers from where you can prove your identity and exert ownership over your online assets. This provides your followers with the assurance that you are who you say you are and that your accounts, blogs, etc. are really yours and not someone pretending to be you.

When you update your profile, your widget will be automatically updated keeping everything up-to-date with a minimum of effort.

Your name, title/tagline, picture, and identity verification indicator are all displayed over a graphical display of all the services that you have included in the online identity section of your PeoplePond profile.
